The customQuestions.txt file overwrites the questions and answers from the game.

The first line in the file will be read in as a question.
example:
How many shots go into a grande latte?

The second line will be the answers displayed on the buttons.
You must seperate the answers by commas.
The first answer provided is saved as the correct answer.
example:
2,16,8,4

In that example the number two would be processed as the correct answer!

The next line will be read as a question and the next will be the answers for that one.
(Even Lines are questions / Odd lines are answers)
Can't have more than 4 answers
